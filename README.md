# 🧠 N-Queens Hybrid AI Solver

Solving the classic **N-Queens problem** using:
- ✅ **Conventional Backtracking** — guaranteed correctness
- 🔥 **A novel hybrid AI approach** — combines **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** and **Simulated Annealing (SA)** for efficient, scalable solutions

---

## 📌 Overview

The N-Queens problem involves placing N queens on an N×N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. This project explores both a conventional recursive solution and an innovative hybrid metaheuristic algorithm designed by the author.

## 🧠 Techniques Used

### 🔁 Backtracking (Conventional)
- Recursive depth-first placement of queens
- Guaranteed to find all valid solutions
- Exponential time complexity — slows down for large N

### 🧬🔥 Hybrid GA + SA (Novel Approach)
- **Genetic Algorithm** for global exploration of the solution space
- **Simulated Annealing** applied to top individuals for local refinement
- Balances convergence speed and solution quality
- Scales well even for **N > 100**
